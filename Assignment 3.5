High Availability of NameNode:

Single Point Of Failure:
     The NameNode is a single point of failure (SPOF) in an HDFS cluster. Each cluster has a single NameNode, and if that host or process became unavailable, the cluster as a whole is unavailable until the NameNode is either restarted or brought up on a new host. 
     
     The reasons for unavailability of NameNode can be:
        1.) A planned event like maintenance work such has upgradation of software or hardware.
        2.) It may also be due to an unplanned event where the NameNode crashes because of some reasons.
      
High Availability:
      
      1.) The concept of High Availability cluster was introduced in Hadoop 2.x to solve the single point of failure problem in Hadoop 1.x.
      2.) HDFS Architecture follows Master/Slave Topology where NameNode acts as a master daemon and is responsible for managing other slave nodes called DataNodes. 
      3.) This single Master Daemon or NameNode becomes a bottleneck.
